Take me home, take me home
Want to feel you close to me
Take me home, take me home
With you is where I wanna be

Wrapped in your arms tonight
Just making love
Music and candlelight
Stars up above

Take me home (take me home), take me home (take me home)
Oh, can't you see I want you near? (Can't you see I want you?)
Take me home (take me home), take me home (take me home)
Ooh, baby, let's get out of here

I'd follow you anywhere
Your place or mine
Just a one night affair
Would be so fine

I'm in Heaven
Seems like Heaven
So much in Heaven

Take me home

Take me home

One night with you
Lying here next to me
It's the right thing to do
It would be ecstasy

I'm in Heaven
Seems like Heaven
So much in Heaven
Take me home

Ooh, baby, take me home (take me home)
Oh, now, c'mon, and make me, baby
C'mon, and take me, take me home (take me home)

Music
Candlelight, so right
Take me home
In your arms tonight
Hold me tight
Take me home
Just me and you forever
Take me home
Home with you
You and me, together
Take me home
Home with you, take me home
Oh, where you have me
Forever (with you)
With you, I'd be walking right out that door (right out that door)

One night with you
Lying here next to me
It's the right thing to do
It would be ecstasy

I'm in Heaven
Seems like Heaven
So much, Heaven

Take me home (take me home), take me home (take me home)
I want to feel you close to me (I want to feel you close)
Take me home (take me home, take me home)
With you is where I wanna be

Wrapped in your arms tonight
Just making love
Music and candlelight
Stars up above

I'm in Heaven
Seems like Heaven, oh-oh-oh (take me, take me home, home with you)
C'mon, and take me
Ooh, baby-baby, take me home (take me home, home with you)
You'd be lying here next to me
Baby, it'd would be ecstasy (take me home, home with you)
Ah, can't you see I want you near? Baby, baby, let's get out of here (take me, take me home, home with you)

I wanna go home with you
I wanna go home with you
Take me home
I wanna get next to you
I wanna get next to you
(Oh, hold me baby, won't you hold me? Take-take, take, won't you take me home?) Take me home
Take me home (I gotta be with you)
I gotta be with you
Take me home (ooh, take me), home with you
I gotta be with you
I gotta be with you
Take me home (ah, take me), home with you

(I want you to) take me
(I want you to) take me
Take me home (take me), home with you
(I want you to) take me
(I want you to) take me
Take me home (take me), home with you
(I want you to) take me
(I want you to) take me
Take me home (ah, take me), home with you

(I want you to) take me
(I want you to) take me
Take me home (take me), home with you
(I want you to) take me
(I want you to) take me
Take me home (ooh, take me), home with you
(I want you to) take me
(I want you to)
