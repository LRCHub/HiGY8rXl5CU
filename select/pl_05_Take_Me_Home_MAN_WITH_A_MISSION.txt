You, you light up in the dark
You're the glow in a priceless
work of art
Oh, I see, I see you shining
star
You're the light through my
window from afar, oh
And don't you forget,
the only thing
that matters is your heartbeat
going strong
Oh, don't you forget,
that nothing else could matter
'cause you know where I belong
Oh take me there
Won't you take me there
Won't you take me home
Oh take me there
Won't you take me there
Won't you take me home
We, we light up the sky
Heaven knows there's no such
thing
as goodbye, oh
'Cause love, love can never die
(love will never die)
We'll forever be burning you
and I, oh
And don't you forget
The only thing
that matters is our heartbeats
going strong
Oh,
Don't you forget,
that nothing else could matter
'cause we know where I belong
Oh take me there
Won't you take me there
Won't you take me home
Oh, take me there
Won't you take me there
Won't you take me home
Oh take me there
Won't you take me there
Won't you take me home
Oh take me there
Won't you take me there
Won't you take me home
