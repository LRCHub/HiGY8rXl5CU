Take me home, take me home
To the place I belong
'Cause I miss ya, and I wish ya would take me home, take me home
Said my goodbyes and hit the road
A head full of dreams in a suitcase of clothes
But I never made it, made it far
'Cause I realized I needed to be where you are
Been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces, now I know
That I've been away for a minute, I've been away for too long
Take me home, take me home
To the place I belong
'Cause I miss ya, and I wish ya would take me home, take me home
Ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Lights in my rearview almost gone
Thought I could make it
Man, was I wrong
Out on my own I could only get so far
Then I realized I needed to be where you are
Been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces, now I know
That I've been away for a minute, that I've been away for too long
Take me home (take me home), take me home
To the place I belong
'Cause I miss ya ('cause I miss ya)
And I wish ya would take me home, take me home
Ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Take me home (ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)
Take me home (oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)
Take me home (come on)
Oh, take me home
Ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
'Cause I miss ya (ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)
Take me home (ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)
Take me home (take me, take me, take me home)
And take me, home
