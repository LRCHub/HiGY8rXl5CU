[00:02.98] Almost heaven, West Virginia
[00:12.34] Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
[00:19.37] Life is old there, older than the trees
[00:24.96] Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze
[00:49.46] 
[00:29.10] Country roads, take me home
[00:33.33] To the place I belong
[00:41.46] West Virginia, Mountain Mama
[00:47.07] Take me home, country roads
[01:00.57] 
[00:53.66] All my memories gather 'round her
[01:01.07] Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
[01:07.70] Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
[01:13.07] Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eyes
[01:36.07] 
[01:18.03] Country roads, take me home
[01:21.00] To the place I belong
[01:29.48] West Virginia, Mountain Mama
[01:34.55] Take me home, country roads
[01:48.05] 
[01:42.72] I hear her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me
[01:47.41] Radio reminds me of my home far away
[01:52.76] Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin'
[01:57.11] That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
[02:21.61] 
[02:04.77] Country roads, take me home
[02:09.81] To the place I belong
[02:13.17] West Virginia, Mountain Mama
[02:21.88] Take me home, country roads, everybody sing
[02:43.38] 
[02:25.80] Country roads, take me home
[02:33.67] To the place I belong
[02:39.90] West Virginia, Mountain Mama
[02:45.54] Take me home, country roads
[02:59.04] 
[02:51.21] Take me home down country roads
[02:56.91] Take me home down country roads
