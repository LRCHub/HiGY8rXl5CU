Follow me,
I need you, I plead you to come through.
Take the lead, you know that I'm right behind you.
I loved you and what do I get back, still not, the feeling you get
When there's someone for you
Take me home, take me home.
I'm alone here, no fear, I'm safe by the lone,
It's a cold world, a lone world, it's hard for a girl,
I wish you'd open up your eyes,
See my pain through all the lies,
In this room i wish i'd die,
Though my tears i do not cry.
Take me home.
Is this the end, you mess up, had back luck,
And take it out on me.
You reprimand me,
My choices, the voices, the way I live my life.
I pray to the angels, stand by me, beside me,
Protect me from pain, and the darkness around.
Take me home, take me home
I'm alone here, have no fear, I'm safe by the lone.
It's a cold world, a lone world, it's hard for a girl,
I wish you'd open up your eyes,
See my pain through all the lies,
In this room I wish I'd die,
Though my tears, i will not cry. Take me home
Take me home.
Take me home.
Take me home.
