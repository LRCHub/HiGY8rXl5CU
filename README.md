# (sic)boy – Take Me Home

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Sunshine on the morning highway
Music recalls my memory
Struggling all your life everyday
When did I rest me lately
Walked this world with my own shoe
All the things are on this winding road
Reaching for the sky we're under
We'll never need that ceiling
Get one thing to lose another
I think I know that feeling
Walk this world with my own shoe
Finding where to be and where to go
So take me home
Just take me home
Cause I have walked this life with my own shoe
I know where I should be so take me home
Off the wall you turn is coming
No need to know each other
Just like California Dreaming
There's nothing here to bother
Thumbs up to you my dear friend
See you once again there where we know
So take me home
Just take me home
Cause I have walked this world with my own shoe
I'm on my way
To take me home
Yes take me home
And I'll go walk this world with my own shoe
Tell us all your dreaming stories
Nothing ever changes you
Would it be the same there for me?
Life goes on with my own shoe
I'll see you once again so take me home
See you once again so take me home
